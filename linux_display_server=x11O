[34m[1mUsage[22m[39m: [1m[93mkitty[39m[22m [options] [program-to-run ...]

Run the [3mkitty[23m terminal emulator. You can also specify the
[3mprogram[23m to run inside [3mkitty[23m as normal arguments
following the [3moptions[23m.
For example: kitty --hold sh -c "echo hello, world"

For comprehensive documentation for kitty, please see:

[34m[1mOptions[22m[39m:
  [32m--class[39m, [32m--app-id[39m=[[3mkitty[23m]
    Set the class part of the [3mWM_CLASS[23m window property. On Wayland, it sets
    the app id.

  [32m--name[39m
    Set the name part of the [3mWM_CLASS[23m property. Defaults to using the value
    from [1m--class[22m.

  [32m-T[39m, [32m--title[39m
    Set the OS window title. This will override any title set by the program
    running inside kitty, permanently fixing the OS window's title. So only
    use this if you are running a program that does not set titles.

  [32m-c[39m, [32m--config[39m
    Specify a path to the configuration file(s) to use. All configuration
    files are merged onto the builtin [3m]8;;file://NixOS/home/logan/.config/kitty/kitty.conf\[4:3;58:5:4mkitty.conf[4:0;59m]8;;\[23m, overriding the builtin
    values. This option can be specified multiple times to read multiple
    configuration files in sequence, which are merged. Use the special
    value [96mNONE[39m to not load any config file.
    
    If this option is not specified, config files are searched for in the
    order: [3m$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kitty/kitty.conf[23m, [3m~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf[23m, 
    [3m$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/kitty/kitty.conf[23m. The first one that exists is used as
    the config file.
    
    If the environment variable ]8;;kitty+doc://NixOS/#ref=envvar-KITTY_CONFIG_DIRECTORY\[4:3;58:5:4mKITTY_CONFIG_DIRECTORY[4:0;59m]8;;\ is specified, that
    directory is always used and the above searching does not happen.
    
    If [3m/etc/xdg/kitty/kitty.conf[23m exists, it is merged before (i.e. with
    lower priority) than any user config files. It can be used to specify
    system-wide defaults for all users. You can use either [96m-[39m or [3m/dev/stdin
    [23mto read the config from STDIN.

  [32m-o[39m, [32m--override[39m
    Override individual configuration options, can be specified multiple
    times. Syntax: [3mname=value[23m. For example: [1m-o[22m font_size=20

  [32m-d[39m, [32m--working-directory[39m, [32m--directory[39m=[[3m.[23m]
    Change to the specified directory when launching.

  [32m--detach[39m
    Detach from the controlling terminal, if any. Not available on macOS. On
    macOS use [96mopen -a kitty.app -n[39m instead.

  [32m--session[39m
    Path to a file containing the startup [3msession[23m (tabs, windows, layout,
    programs). Use - to read from STDIN. See ]8;;kitty+doc://NixOS/#ref=sessions\[4:3;58:5:4msessions[4:0;59m]8;;\ for details and an
    example. Environment variables in the file name are expanded, relative
    paths are resolved relative to the kitty configuration directory. The
    special value [96mnone[39m means no session will be used, even if the 
    [1mstartup_session[22m option has been specified in kitty.conf. Note that using
    this option means the command line arguments to kitty specifying a
    program to run are ignored.

  [32m--hold[39m
    Remain open, at a shell prompt, after child process exits. Note that
    this only affects the first window. You can quit by either using the
    close window shortcut or running the exit command.

  [32m-1[39m, [32m--single-instance[39m
    If specified only a single instance of [3mkitty[23m will run. New invocations
    will instead create a new top-level window in the existing [3mkitty
    [23minstance. This allows [3mkitty[23m to share a single sprite cache on the GPU
    and also reduces startup time. You can also have separate groups of 
    [3mkitty[23m instances by using the [1m--instance-group[22m option.

  [32m--instance-group[39m
    Used in combination with the [1m--single-instance[22m option. All [3mkitty
    [23minvocations with the same [1m--instance-group[22m will result in new windows
    being created in the first [3mkitty[23m instance within that group.

  [32m--wait-for-single-instance-window-close[39m
    Normally, when using [1m--single-instance[22m, [3mkitty[23m will open a new window in
    an existing instance and quit immediately. With this option, it will
    not quit till the newly opened window is closed. Note that if no
    previous instance is found, then [3mkitty[23m will wait anyway, regardless of
    this option.

  [32m--listen-on[39m
    Listen on the specified socket address for control messages. For
    example, [1m--listen-on[22m=unix:/tmp/mykitty or [1m--listen-on
    [22m=tcp:localhost:12345. On Linux systems, you can also use abstract UNIX
    sockets, not associated with a file, like this: [1m--listen-on
    [22m=unix:@mykitty. Environment variables are expanded and relative paths
    are resolved with respect to the temporary directory. To control kitty,
    you can send commands to it with [3mkitten @[23m using the [1m--to[22m option to
    specify this address. Note that if you run [3mkitten @[23m within a kitty
    window, there is no need to specify the [1m--to[22m option as it will
    automatically read from the environment. Note that this will be ignored
    unless [1mallow_remote_control[22m is set to either: [96myes[39m, [96msocket[39m or 
    [96msocket-only[39m. This can also be specified in [3m]8;;file://NixOS/home/logan/.config/kitty/kitty.conf\[4:3;58:5:4mkitty.conf[4:0;59m]8;;\[23m.

  [32m--start-as[39m=[[3mnormal[23m]
    Control how the initial kitty window is created.
    Choices: minimized, normal, fullscreen, maximized

[34m[1mDebugging options[22m[39m:
  [32m-v[39m, [32m--version[39m
    The current kitty version.

  [32m--dump-commands[39m
    Output commands received from child process to STDOUT.

  [32m--replay-commands[39m
    Replay previously dumped commands. Specify the path to a dump file
    previously created by [1m--dump-commands[22m. You can open a new kitty window
    to replay the commands with:
    
        kitty sh -c "kitty --replay-commands /path/to/dump/file; read"

  [32m--dump-bytes[39m
    Path to file in which to store the raw bytes received from the child
    process.

  [32m--debug-rendering[39m, [32m--debug-gl[39m
    Debug rendering commands. This will cause all OpenGL calls to check for
    errors instead of ignoring them. Also prints out miscellaneous debug
    information. Useful when debugging rendering problems.

  [32m--debug-keyboard[39m, [32m--debug-input[39m
    Print out key and mouse events as they are received.

  [32m--debug-font-fallback[39m
    Print out information about the selection of fallback fonts for
    characters not present in the main font.

  [32m--watcher[39m
